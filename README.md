### Description of the Project
This is a game in which the player must throw different coloured balls into hoops. The game is set in space, in between a planet that has been split in half. The player starts within a mysterious structure and must throw the ball into the hoop to proceed.

### Instructions For Use
The game is quite simple. It is played in VR. The player can move around with the left thumbstick, turn with the right and pick up and throw certain objects. That is all the player needs to play.

### What I Am Most Proud Of:
I am very proud of the aesthetic of the project. It is very surreal and strange-looking, which was my goal. I am a big fan of weird games, which was hopefully shown off well in this project.

### What I Learned:
I learned that organisation and a clear plan of what I am to do is necessary in order to avoid rushing near the end. During this project, I feel I was quite disorganised, and many of the ideas I wished to implement into the game would have taken far too much time to do so.
In addition to this, I also managed to get Lerp working and used particle systems for the first time in Unity. These will prove useful to me in the future.
I also learned how to use a basic outline shader, which I plan to use in a great many projects going forward.

### Proposal:
Space-ketball - A VR game that involves throwing planets around. The planets are all out of whack! Using the rings as your hoop, you must throw each planet into the correct set of rings. The game gets progressively harder the farther along you go.
